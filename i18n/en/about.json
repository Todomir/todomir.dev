    "tcc": "Throughout 2018, I started working on my <abbr title=\"Course Conclusion Work\">TCC</abbr>, setting up a platform that facilitated the connection between students so they could provide tutoring, and thus, help each other.",
    "jsp": "The problem is that I was using <abbr title=\"Java Server Pages\">JSP</abbr>, and absolutely no one should use <abbr title=\"Java Server Pages\">JSP</abbr> for anything. I was almost giving up when I decided that I was going to redo the platform, but this time using React and Node.js. And I'm glad I did it, because I started to understand the value of a good website.",
    "websites": "I ended up realizing that websites are like windows to someone's world. A way to send a message to the world.",
